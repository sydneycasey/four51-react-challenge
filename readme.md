//Instructions
Modify the Lunch App in the following ways

1. Add a column to the results table to calculate the percent of total votes recieved (should be to the right of vote counts)

2. Dynamically reorder the list of restaurants based on number of votes recieved (the restaurant with the most votes should be at the top of the list)

3. Allow the user to add a new restaurant so that the restaurant will show up in the results and user can cast votes (use the existing Restaurants.js component).

4. In the Restaurants component, give the user the ability to delete a restaurant from the poll.

5. Implement styling to make the application look more professional and user friendly. Bootstap has been included in this project as a dependency, feel free to use it if you like.
